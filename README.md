## flower

`flower` is a simple kanban board written with React and Redux storing the data using `localStorage`. Hence no data is transferred to any servers.

### Getting started

`yarn` and then `yarn start`. Since the board is using `localStorage`, you can reload the page and the data will persist.

You can also try it out here: https://ragzter.github.io/flower/

### Why?

Just a hobby project to practise React and Redux and in fact also because I personally want to use it. I feel like all other alternatives are bloated / cost money.
